Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I have done some academic research projects on Data Visualizations 
and Data Analysis. While they are not Data Science, I found that I was really interested in working with large 
data sets and visualizing patterns. Therefore, I decided to take CMSC320 to learn about Data Science and see if
it could be a possible career path in the near future.
